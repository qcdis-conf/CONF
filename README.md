# About 

CONF  allows application developers to seamlessly plan a customized virtual infrastructure based on application 
level constraints on QoS and resource budgets, provisioning the virtual infrastructure using standardized interfaces 
(e.g., TOSCA and OCCI), deploy application components onto the virtual infrastructure, and start execution on demand.
 
CONF is developed by the research team for QCDIS team (quality critical distributed computing), in the 
[MNS group [(Multi scale networking),(https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/sne/research/mns/)]
of the University of Amsterdam. The development of CONF is coordinated by Dr. Zhiming Zhao. Core developers
